SOLUTION:-

SELECT h.hacker_id, h.name, COUNT(c.challenge_id) as c_count
FROM Hackers h 
INNER JOIN Challenges c ON c.hacker_id = h.hacker_id
GROUP BY h.hacker_id, h.name
HAVING COUNT(c.challenge_id) = (
    SELECT COUNT(c2.challenge_id) as c_max 
    FROM Challenges c2 
    GROUP BY c2.hacker_id 
    ORDER BY c_max DESC
    LIMIT 1
) 
OR COUNT(c.challenge_id) IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT c_compare as c_unique 
    FROM (
        SELECT h2.hacker_id, h2.name, COUNT(c.challenge_id) as c_compare 
        FROM Hackers h2 
        INNER JOIN Challenges c ON h2.hacker_id = c.hacker_id
        GROUP BY h2.hacker_id, h2.name
    ) counts
    GROUP BY c_compare 
    HAVING COUNT(c_compare) = 1
)
ORDER BY c_count DESC, h.hacker_id;
